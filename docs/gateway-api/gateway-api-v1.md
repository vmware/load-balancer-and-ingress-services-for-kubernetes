## Gateway API

AKO claims support for the v1 release of Gateway API. To enable this feature the field `GatewayAPI` under section `featureGates` in values.yaml must be set to **true**. This will spin up a new container within the AKO pod which will handle the Gateway API related objects.

In the current release, the following objects in the Gateway API are supported by AKO:
  1. GatewayClass (v1)
  2. Gateway (v1)
  3. HTTPRoute (v1)

**NOTE:** AKO Gateway API supports all the fields which are mentioned as **Support: Core** in the above objects for the current release(with a few exceptions. See limitations below). Other objects in the Gateway API and fields in the GatewayClass, Gateway and HTTPRoute will be supported in the future releases.

### Support Matrix

|                | GatewayClass | Gateway | HTTPRoute |   GRPCRoute   |   TLSRoute    |   TCPRoute    |   UDPRoute    | ReferenceGrant |
|:--------------:|:------------:|:-------:|:---------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|----------------|
| release-1.13.1 |      v1      |   v1    |    v1     | Not Supported | Not Supported | Not Supported | Not Supported | Not Supported  |

### Installation

The steps mentioned below must be followed to enable the GatewayAPI feature in AKO:

  1. Set the `GatewayAPI` under the section `featureGates` to **true** in the `values.yaml`
  2. Do a helm install or upgrade using the edited `values.yaml` to install or upgrade the AKO

A GatewayClass `avi-lb` with `controllerName` as `ako.vmware.com/avi-lb` will get installed as part of the installation. An Infrastructure Provider can ask the cluster operators to use this GatewayClass in their Gateway objects so that the AKO honours the objects created by them.

**NOTE:** The GatewayClass, Gateway, and Route CRD definitions must be installed on the cluster before enabling the GatewayAPI feature in AKO. The CRDs can be found [here](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/tree/main/config/crd/standard).

### Named Route Rules Support

Starting from **AKO 2.1.1**, AKO supports Gateway API v1.3+ which introduces the [Named Route Rules](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/reference/spec/#httprouterule) field (`HTTPRoute → rules → name`). When this field is specified, AKO uses the rule name instead of the jsonified match in the naming convention for ChildVS, Pool, and PoolGroup.

**Key Behaviors:**
- The `rule → name` field is **optional** and must be **unique** within an HTTPRoute if set.
- If multiple rules have the same `rule → name`, the HTTPRoute will be rejected with Accepted condition set to `False` and message: "Route contains multiple rules with duplicate names"
- If `rule → name` is not set for a rule, the legacy naming convention (using sha1 of HTTPRoute rule match) will be used for that rule's ChildVS, Pool, and PoolGroup.
- HTTPRoutes can have a mix of named and unnamed rules - each will use the appropriate naming convention.
- On upgrade from older AKO versions, existing ChildVSes, Pools, and PoolGroups remain unchanged unless the HTTPRoute is updated to include named rules. Upon modification, old objects will be deleted and new ones created.

**Example HTTPRoute with Named Rule:**

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: insecure-http-route
  namespace: test-httproute-ns
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - name: test-insecure-gateway
    sectionName: http
  hostnames:
  - "products.avi.internal"
  rules:
  - name: test-rule-name
    matches:
    - path:
        value: "/foo"
    backendRefs:
    - name: app-http
      port: 80
```

For the above HTTPRoute, the object names would be:
- **ChildVS**: `ako-gw-<cluster-name>--<sha1 hash of <gateway-namespace>-test-insecure-gateway-test-httproute-ns-insecure-http-route-<stringified FNV1a_32 hash of bytes(test-rule-name)>>`
- **Pool**: `ako-gw-<cluster-name>--<sha1 hash of <gateway-namespace>-test-insecure-gateway-test-httproute-ns-insecure-http-route-<stringified FNV1a_32 hash of bytes(test-rule-name)>-<backendRefs_namespace>-app-http-80>`
- **PoolGroup**: `ako-gw-<cluster-name>–-<sha1 hash of <gateway-namespace>-test-insecure-gateway-test-httproute-ns-insecure-http-route-<stringified FNV1a_32 hash of bytes(test-rule-name)>>`

For detailed naming conventions, see [naming conventions](../naming-conventions/ako-gateway-api.md).

### Gateway API Objects

#### GatewayClass

GatewayClass aggregates a group of Gateway objects, similar to how IngressClass aggregates a group of Ingress objects. GatewayClasses formalizes types of load balancing implementations which can be different for different load-balancing vendors (Avi/Nginx/HAProxy etc.).

AKO identifies GatewayClasses that point to `ako.vmware.com/avi-lb` as the `.spec.controllerName` value, in the GatewayClass object. 

A sample GatewayClass object can look something like this:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
  kind: GatewayClass
  metadata:
    name: avi-lb
  spec:
    controllerName: "ako.vmware.com/avi-lb"
  ```

It is important that the `.spec.controllerName` value specified MUST match `ako.vmware.com/avi-lb` for AKO to honor the GatewayClass and corresponding Gateway API objects.

**NOTE:** A GatewayClass named `avi-lb` will get installed as part of the helm install or upgrade when the user enables the Gateway API feature. 

#### Gateway

The Gateway object represents an instance of a service-traffic handling infrastructure by binding Listeners to a set of IP addresses. The AKO validates the Gateway object and checks if the listeners are valid and sets `ListenerConditionAccepted` to `true`. If one or more listener in a gateway is valid, `GatewayConditionAccepted` is set to `true`. It then checks whether all the references specified in the gateway listeners are valid and exist and then sets `ListenerConditionResolvedRefs` to `true` accordingly. It then translates the Gateway and its configuration to a Parent VS. The listeners in Gateway is mapped to service ports in Parent VS and secrets will be configured as Certificates in the AVI controller and will be referenced in the same Parent VS. AKO updates the status of Gateway with `GatewayConditionProgrammed` as `true` along with the VIP of the Parent VS once the VS creation is completed and sets `ListenerConditionProgrammed` to `true` if respective listener is programmed.

The parent VS created by AKO follows the naming convention `ako-gw-<cluster-name>--<namespace of the gateway>-<name of the gateway>-EVH`

A sample Gateway object is shown below:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
  kind: Gateway
  metadata:
    name: my-gateway
  spec:
    gatewayClassName: avi-lb
    listeners:
    - name: foo-http
      protocol: HTTP
      port: 80
      hostname: *.example.com
    - name: bar-https
      protocol: HTTPS
      port: 443
      hostname: *.example.com
      tls:
        certificateRefs:
        - kind: Secret
          group: ""
          name: bar-example-com-cert
  ```

The above Gateway object would correspond to a single Layer-7 Virtual Service in the AVI controller, with two ports (80, 443) exposed and an sslKeyAndCertificate created based on the Secret **bar-example-com-cert**.

AKO only supports HTTP and HTTPS as protocol.

AKO only supports Secret kind for certificateRefs.

Users can also configure a user-preferred static IPv4 address in the Gateway Object using the `.spec.addresses` field as shown below. This would configure the Layer 7 virtual service with a static IP as mentioned in the Gateway Object.

  ```yaml
  spec:
    addresses:
    - type: IPAddress
      value: 10.1.1.10
  ```

**NOTE:** AKO claims support for a single address of type IPAddress. The Gateway must be re-created to update the address.

#### HTTPRoute

The HTTPRoute object provides a way to route HTTP requests. The AKO models a child VS based on this object. AKO supports match requests based on the hostname, path, and header specified. The filters to specify additional processing of the requests will be added as policy in the child VS by the AKO. The filters of type `RequestHeaderModifier`, `RequestRedirect`, `UrlRewrite` and `ResponseHeaderModifier` are supported in the current release.

A sample HTTPRoute object is shown below:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
  kind: HTTPRoute
  metadata:
    name: my-http-app
  spec:
    parentRefs:
    - name: my-gateway
    hostnames:
    - "foo.example.com"
    rules:
    - matches:
      - path:
          type: PathPrefix
          value: /bar
      backendRefs:
      - name: my-service1
        port: 8080
    - filters:
      - type: RequestHeaderModifier
        requestHeaderModifier:
          add:
            - name: my-header
              value: foo
      matches:
      - headers:
        - type: Exact
          name: magic
          value: foo
        path:
          type: PathPrefix
          value: /foo
      backendRefs:
      - name: my-service2
        port: 8080
        weight: 1
      - name: my-service3
        port: 8081
        weight: 2
  ```

The above HTTPRoute object gets translated to two child virtual services in the Avi Load Balancer Controller. One child virtual service with match criteria as the path begins with `/bar` and a single Pool Group with a single pool and another child virtual service with match criteria as path begins with `/foo` and header with name as `magic` and value as `foo`, a single Pool Group with two pools and an HTTP Request policy to add `my-header` with value `foo` to the HTTP request forwarded to the back-ends.

**NOTE:** Hostnames are mandatory and can be prefixed with a wildcard.

**NOTE:** AKO Gateway APIs does not support `filters` within `backendRefs`.

### Gateway API Objects to AVI Controller Objects Mapping

In AKO Gateway API Implementation, Gateway objects corresponds to following AVI Controller objects:

  1. `Gateway` translates to an `EVH Parent Virtual Service` with `port/protocol` from each `Listener` added as the `Service` within parent VS.
  2. `tls specification (certificate refs)` from each `Gateway Listener` will get added to the parent VS as `SSLKeyAndCertificateRef`. 
  3. Every `Secret` created corresponds to an `SSLKeyAndCertificate` object.
  4. `Addresses` in a Gateway specification gets added as static ip for `Vsvip` for parent VS.
  5. Each `hostname`, except `wild card hostnames`, specified in a Gateway listener is mapped to the `DNS` in the `Vsvip` of the parent VS.
  6. Every `Rule` in `HTTPRoute` corresponds to an `EVH Child Virtual Service`, with `Match` translated to `VH match` and `Filters` translated to `HTTPPolicySet` configuration. If no matches are specified for a particular HTTPRoute rule, a childVS with path as `/` in `VHmatch` will be created and attached to the parentVS corresponding to that rule.
  7. If `hostname` specified in httproute is a complete FQDN, it will be part of `VSVIP` dnsinfo. All `hostnames` mentioned in HTTPRoute will be part of `hostname` of `VHMatch` of Child VS.
  8. Each `backendRefs` specification (list of backends) in a `HTTPRoute Rule` will be added as a `Pool Group`.
  9. Each `backendRef` in a `HTTPRoute Rule` will be translated to a `Pool`.
  10. Every parentVS will have a default `HTTPPolicyset` attached to it which will return `404`, if no path matches a given HTTP request.     

### HTTPRoute Filter Objects Mapping
 
#### RequestHeaderModifier:

HTTPRoute RequestHeaderModifier Filter in AKO Gateway API implementation is supported using `HTTP Request Rule -> Modify Header` action of `HTTPPolicySet`. Once, a `RequestHeaderModifier` fllter is found in a rule in an HTTPRoute, AKO will add an HTTPpolicyset with a HTTPRequestRule and action as `Modify Header` to the childVS corresponding to the rule with `Add/Remove/Replace Header` as specified in the crd. Whenever the traffic lands on that child VS, the Headers will be modified before being sent to the Backend Server.

 A sample httproute with RequestHeaderModifier filter is shown below:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
  kind: HTTPRoute
  metadata:
    name: httproute-with-filter-header
    namespace: test-httproute-ns
  spec:
    parentRefs:
    - name: test-insecure-gateway
      sectionName: http
    hostnames:
    - "products.avi.internal"
    rules:
    - matches:
        - path:
            value: "/foo"
      backendRefs:
      - name: app-http
        port: 80
      filters:
      - type: RequestHeaderModifier
        requestHeaderModifier:
          add:
          - name: request-header
            value: test-request-header
          remove:
          - test-remove-header
  ```

For the above yaml, an HTTPPolicySet with a `HTTP Request Rule ` with action as `Modify Header` having `Add Header -> Header Name` as `request-header` and `Header Value` as `test-request-header` and `Remove Header -> Header Name` as `test-remove-header` will be added to the childVS corresponding to the rule. When the request comes for host and path `products.avi.internal/foo` , a header with name as `request-header` and value as `test-request-header` will be added to the request before it is being sent to the backend server. Also , if there is any header with name "test-remove-header" is present, it will be removed.

#### RequestRedirect:

HTTPRoute RequestHeaderModifier Filter in AKO Gateway API implementation is supported using `HTTP Request Rule -> Redirect` action of HTTPPolicySet. Currently we support only `hostname` and `statusCode` redirection. Once, a `RequestRedirect` fllter is found in a rule in an HTTPRoute, AKO will add an HTTPpolicyset with HTTPRequestRule and action as `Redirect` to the childVS corresponding to the rule. Whenever the traffic lands on that child VS, a response with the `redirect hostname` and `statusCode` as specified in the HTTPRoute RequestRedirect filter spec will be sent back.

 A sample httproute with RequestRedirect filter is shown below:

  ```yaml
    apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
    kind: HTTPRoute
    metadata:
      name: insecure-http-route
      namespace: test-httproute-ns
    spec:
      parentRefs:
      - name: test-insecure-gateway
        sectionName: http
      hostnames:
      - "products.avi.internal"
      rules:
      - matches:
        - path:
            value: "/foo"
        filters:
        - type: RequestRedirect
          requestRedirect:
            statusCode: 302
            hostname: "apps.avi.internal"
  ```

For the above yaml, an HTTPPolicySet with a rule with action as `Redirect` with `Redirect-> Status Code` as `302` and `Redirect-> Host` as `apps.avi.internal` will be added to the childVS corresponding to the rule. When the request comes for host and path `products.avi.internal/foo` , redirect host will be set to `apps.avi.internal` and response code will be set to `302` before the response is sent back to the client.

#### UrlRewrite:

HTTPRoute RequestHeaderModifier Filter in AKO Gateway API implementation is supported using `HTTP Request Rule -> Rewrite URL` action of HTTPPolicySet. Currently we support only `hostname` and `path` rewrite. Once, a `urlRewrite` fllter is found in a rule in an HTTPRoute, AKO will add an HTTPpolicyset with HTTPRequestRule and action as `Rewrite URL` to the childVS corresponding to the rule. Whenever the traffic lands on that child VS, the path and the hostname will changed to the rewtite path and hostname specified in the HTTPRoute URLRewrite filter specification.

 A sample httproute with UrlRewrite filter is shown below:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
  kind: HTTPRoute
  metadata:
    name: insecure-http-route
    namespace: test-httproute-ns
  spec:
    parentRefs:
    - name: test-insecure-gateway
      sectionName: http
    hostnames:
    - "products.avi.internal"
    rules:
    - matches:
      - path:
         value: "/foo"
      backendRefs:
      - name: app-http
        port: 80
      filters:
      - type: URLRewrite
        urlRewrite:
          hostname: rewrittenhostname.avi.internal
          path:
          type: ReplaceFullPath
          replaceFullPath: /bar
      - type: RequestHeaderModifier
        requestHeaderModifier:
          add:
          - name: request-header
            value: test-request-header
  ```

For the above yaml, an HTTPPolicySet with a rule with action as `Rewrite URL` with `Rewrite URL-> Host Header` as `rewrittenhostname.avi.internal` and `Rewrite URL-> Path` as `/bar` will be added to the childVS corresponding to the rule. When the request comes for host and path `products.avi.internal/foo` , host will be changed to `rewrittenhostname.avi.internal` and path will be changed to `/bar` before it is being sent to the backend server.

#### ResponseHeaderModifier:
HTTPRoute RequestHeaderModifier Filter in AKO Gateway API implementation is supported using `HTTP Response Rule -> Modify Header` action of HTTPPolicySet. Once, a `ResponseHeaderModifier` fllter is found in a rule in an HTTPRoute, AKO will add an HTTPpolicyset with a HTTPResponseRule and action as `Modify Header` to the childVS corresponding to the rule with `Add/Remove/Replace Header` as specified in the crd. Whenever the traffic lands on that child VS, the Headers will be modified before the response is being sent back to the client.

A sample httproute with ResponseHeaderModifier filter is shown below:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
  kind: HTTPRoute
  metadata:
    name: httproute-with-filter-header
    namespace: test-httproute-ns
  spec:
    parentRefs:
    - name: test-insecure-gateway
      sectionName: http
    hostnames:
    - "products.avi.internal"
    rules:
    - matches:
        - path:
          value: "/foo"
      backendRefs:
      - name: app-http
        port: 80
      filters:
      - type: ResponseHeaderModifier
        responseHeaderModifier:
          add:
          - name: response-header
            value: test-response-header
  ```

For the above yaml, an HTTPPolicySet with a `HTTP Response Rule ` with action as `Modify Header` having `Add Header -> Header Name` as `response-header` and `Header Value` as `test-response-header` will be added to the childVS corresponding to the rule. When the request comes for host and path `products.avi.internal/foo` , a header with name as `request-header` and value as `test-request-header` will be added to the response before it is being sent back to the client.


### ExtensionRef Usage

AKO supports ExtensionRef filters in HTTPRoute to attach custom resource definitions (CRDs) for additional configuration. ExtensionRefs can be attached at two different levels:

#### Rule-Level Filters

ExtensionRefs at the rule level (`rules[].filters[]`) apply configuration to the entire rule:

- **L7Rule** - Modifies Virtual Service properties. See [L7Rule CRD documentation](../crds/l7rule.md)
- **ApplicationProfile** - Configures custom application profiles (TODO: Add link to ApplicationProfile documentation)

Example:
```yaml
rules:
  - filters:
      - type: ExtensionRef
        extensionRef:
          group: ako.vmware.com
          kind: L7Rule
          name: my-l7-rule
      - type: ExtensionRef
        extensionRef:
          group: ako.vmware.com
          kind: ApplicationProfile
          name: my-application-profile
    backendRefs:
      - name: my-service
        port: 8080
```


#### BackendRef-Level Filters

ExtensionRefs at the backendRefs level (`rules[].backendRefs[].filters[]`) apply configuration to specific backends:

- **HealthMonitor** - Configures custom health monitoring. See [HealthMonitor CRD documentation](../crds/healthmonitor.md)
- **RouteBackendExtension** - Configures backend properties including load balancing, persistence, and health monitoring. See [RouteBackendExtension CRD documentation](../crds/routebackendextension.md)

Example:
```yaml
rules:
  - backendRefs:
      - name: my-service
        port: 8080
        filters:
          - type: ExtensionRef
            extensionRef:
              group: ako.vmware.com
              kind: HealthMonitor
              name: my-health-monitor
          - type: ExtensionRef
            extensionRef:
              group: ako.vmware.com
              kind: RouteBackendExtension
              name: my-route-backend-extension
```


**Note**: 
* Multiple HealthMonitor ExtensionRefs can be attached to a single backendRef. For other CRD kinds, only one instance per kind is allowed.
* HealthMonitors referred through ExtensionRefs take higher priority than HealthMonitors defined in RouteBackendExtension.
* If any ExtensionRef becomes invalid, all the default values will be applied. 

### Wildcard handling in Hostnames

In the current release, AKO Gateway will support following hostname combinations in Gateway listener and HTTPRoute:

  1. Wildcard prefixed hostname(like `*.avi.internal`) at Gateway listener and Non wildcard hostname(like `bar.avi.internal`) at HTTPRoute.
  2. Non-wildcard hotsname(like `bar.avi.internal`) at Gateway listener and wildcard prefixed hostname(like `*.avi.internal`) at HTTPRoute.
  3. Empty hotsname at Gateway listener(like `*`) and Non-wildcard and wildcard prefixed hostname(like `bar.avi.internal/*.avi.internal`) at HTTPRoute.

### Support for Regular Expression in HTTPRoute path:

AKO Gateway API supports `Regular Expression` in HTTPRoute Path, present in `Matches` section of `HTTPRoute`. For each `path` defined in HTTPRoute, AKO GatewayAPI adds that as `Path Match criteria` in `VHMatch` of the rule of Child VirtualService.
When HTTPRoute contains `path` with type as `RegularExpression`, AKO Gateway will parse it and add it as `Path -> Criteria` as `Regex pattern matches` with `Enable Match Case` set to `true`.

 A sample httproute with path as regular expression is shown below:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
  kind: HTTPRoute
  metadata:
    name: test-insecure-httproute
    namespace: test-gateway-ns
  spec:
    hostnames:
    - foo.avi.internal
    parentRefs:
    - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
      kind: Gateway
      name: test-insecure-gateway
      sectionName: http
    rules:
    - backendRefs:
      - group: ""
        kind: Service
        name: app-http-service
        port: 80
        weight: 1
      matches:
      - path:
          type: RegularExpression
          value: /(v1/v2)/(*.)
  ```

  For Regex path mentioned in above HTTPRoute example, AKO Gateway will create `VHMatch path` with `Criteria` as `Regex pattern matches` and `Enable Match Case` set to `true`and path value (Regex) as `/(v1/v2)/(*.)`. 

### HTTP Traffic Splitting

In the current release, AKO Gateway will support the Canary and Blue-Green traffic rollout. The configurations corresponding to this can be found [here](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/traffic-splitting/)

### Status of Gateway API objects

AKO updates the status of all Gateway API objects with proper reasons. A typical status consists of a reason for the acceptance or rejection using which a user can debug the Gateway API object configuration.

A sample status of the Gateway is shown below:

  ```yaml
  Status:
    Addresses:
      Type:   IPAddress
      Value:  100.66.176.6
    Conditions:
      Last Transition Time:  2024-12-02T07:20:25Z
      Message:               Gateway configuration is valid
      Observed Generation:   1
      Reason:                Accepted
      Status:                True
      Type:                  Accepted
      Last Transition Time:  2024-12-02T07:21:20Z
      Message:               Virtual service configured/updated

        Message:               Listener is valid
        Observed Generation:   1
        Reason:                Accepted
        Status:                True
        Type:                  Accepted
        Last Transition Time:  2024-12-02T07:20:25Z
        Message:               All the references are valid
        Observed Generation:   1
        Reason:                ResolvedRefs
        Status:                True
        Type:                  ResolvedRefs

### Conditions and Caveats

#### Gateway Limitations

AKO accepts the following Gateway configuration for this release:
  
  1. Gateway MUST contain at least one listener configuration in it.
  2. Gateway MUST NOT contain protocols other than HTTP or HTTPS.
  3. Gateway MUST NOT contain TLS modes other than `Terminate`.
  4. Two Gateways MUST NOT have listeners with same/overlapping hostname.
  5. AKO does not support the `selector` option within the `from` field of the `allowedRoutes.namespaces` section in a Gateway listener. This means you cannot use label selectors to specify which namespaces are allowed for routes.
  
  

#### HTTPRoute Limitations

AKO accepts the following HTTPRoute configuration for this release:

  1. HTTPRoute MUST contain at least one parent reference.
  2. HTTPRoute MUST NOT contain `*` as hostname.
  3. HTTPRoute MUST specify atleat one hostname.
  4. HTTPRoute MUST contain at least one hostname match with parent Gateway.
  5. Filters nested inside BackendRefs are not supported i.e. `HTTPRoute-> spec-> rules-> backendRefs-> filters` are not supported whereas `HTTPRoute-> spec-> rules-> filters` is supported.
  6. HTTPRoute `urlRewrite` filter currently supports only `replaceFullPath` as path value.
  7. HTTPRoute with one or more invalid rules will get rejected.

#### Resource Creation

AKO Gateway API imposes a restriction on the order of GatewayClass and Gateway creation i.e. GatewayClass must be created before Gateway.

AKO allows creation/updation of HTTPRoute and Gateway in any order except for following cases which requires an explicit AKO reboot to work.
 1. When one gateway attached to multiple routes, having all valid listeners, transitions to gateway with some invalid listeners.
 2. When one gateway attached to multiple routes, having all valid listeners, transitions to gateway with all invalid listeners.
 3. When one gateway attached to multiple routes, having some valid listeners, transitions to gateway with all invalid listeners.
 4. When one gateway attached to one route, having some valid listeners, transitions to gateway with all invalid listeners.
 5. When one gateway attached to one route, having all valid listeners, transitions to gateway with all invalid listeners.

#### High Availability Support

AKO in active-stand-by mode does not support Gateway APIs. Avi continues to deliver highly available L4 and L7 LBs for Gateway APIs.

#### Configuring Static IP address

The AKO supports Gateway objects with a single IPv4 address. The user can configure their preferred static IPv4 address by specifying `spec.addresses` in the Gateway object. A sample configuration is shown below:

  ```yaml
  spec:
    addresses:
    - type: IPAddress
      value: 10.1.1.10
  ```

**NOTE:** The address of type IPAddress is only supported. The length of the addresses is also limited to a single address.

#### Kubernetes Service types

AKO Gateway API supports `ClusterIP`, `NodePort` and `NodePortLocal` Service types.

#### Container Network Interface (CNI) providers

AKO Gateway API claims support for `Calico` and `Antrea` as CNI provider.

#### Platforms/ Environments supported

AKO Gateway API is supported on `Kubernetes` platform.

#### Cloud Service Providers

AKO Gateway API claims support for `VMware vCenter/vSphere ESX` and `NSX-T` Cloud.
