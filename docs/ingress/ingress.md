AKO, from 1.3.1 claims partial support for networking/v1 Ingress, released for general availability starting kubernetes 1.19. 


#### networking/v1 Ingress specific features supported in AKO

1. IngressClass
2. Default IngressClass

AKO automatically detects whether ingress-class api is enabled/available in the cluster it is operating in. If the ingress-class api is enabled, AKO switches to use the IngressClass objects, instead of the previously available alternative of using `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` annotations in Ingress objects. 

#### Avi IngressClass object
IngressClass corresponding to AKO as the ingress controller gets deployed as part of helm install/upgrade (AKO 1.3.1+). Helm autodetects the presence  of IngressClass api enabled on the cluster, and if it does, creates the IngressClass object. The IngressClass object should look something like this:

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: IngressClass
metadata:
  name: avi-lb
spec:
  controller: ako.vmware.com/avi-lb
  parameters:
    apiGroup: ako.vmware.com
    kind: IngressParameters
    name: external-lb
```

Although, it is OK to use any other names for the IngressClass, it is important that the `.spec.controller` value specified MUST match `ako.vmware.com/avi-lb`.

As part of the helm install/upgrade, if the `defaultIngController` is set to `true`, AKO's helm chart would apply the `ingressclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class` as so:

```
metadata:
  name: avi-lb
  annotations:
    ingressclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: "true"
```

Setting the `ingressclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class` to `"true"` enables AKO to implement all Ingresses, even if the `ingressClassName` is not explicitly specified/kept `None` in the Ingress objects.
The `ingressclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class` annotation comes in handy when upgrading to an IngressClass enabled cluster. This is because while upgrading Ingresses from the ingress class annotation approach to the IngressClass object approach, the upgraded Ingresses would end having `ingressClassName` set to `None`.

### Ingress and Avi IngressClass
In order to provide a controller to implement a given ingress, in addition to creating the IngressClass object, the `ingressClassName` should be speecified, that matches the IngressClass name. The ingress would look like:

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: my-ingress
spec:
  ingressClassName: avi-lb
  rules:
    - host: myinsecurehost.avi.internal
      http:
        paths:
        - path: /foo
          backend:
            serviceName: service1
            servicePort: 80
```

Alternatively, if the `ingressClassName` is empty, AKO checks for `ingressclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class` to be set to true on an IngressClass belonging to AKO (with `.spec.controller: ako.vmware.com/avi-lb`).

Removing an Avi IngressClass from the cluster would delete all Ingress associated objects from Avi, therefore it is suggested to handle IngressClass with caution.

### Default Secret for Ingress

This feature can be used when the user wants to apply a common key-cert for multiple Ingresses, e.g. a wild carded secret which can be used for all host names in the same subdomain.

To use this feature: 
- A Secret with name `router-certs-default` has to be created in the same namespace where AKO pod is running (avi-system). The Secret must have tls.crt and tls.key fields in its data section.
- Additonally, alt.crt and alt.key fields can be populated to allow multiple default certificates when trying to configure both RSA and ECC signed certificates. Avi Controller allows a Virtual Service to be configured with two certificates at a time, one each of RSA and ECC. This enables Avi Controller to negotiate the optimal algorithm or cipher with the client. If the client supports ECC, in that case the ECC algorithm is preferred, and RSA is used as a fallback in cases where the clients do not support ECC.
- The annotation "ako.vmware.com/enable-tls" has to be added in the desired Ingresses with its value set to "true"

An example of the default secret is given bellow:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: router-certs-default
  namespace: avi-system
type: kubernetes.io/tls
data:
  tls.key: 
    paste here content of PRIVATE KEY
  tls.crt:
    paste here content of CERTIFICATE
  alt.key:
    paste here content of ALTERNATE PRIVATE KEY
  alt.crt:
    paste here content of ALTERNATE CERTIFICATE
```

Example of an Ingress using this default secret via annotation is given bellow:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: ingress1
  annotations:
    ako.vmware.com/enable-tls: "true"
spec:
  ingressClassName: avi-lb
  rules:
  - host: "ingr1.avi.internal"
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /foo
        backend:
          service:
            name: avisvc1
            port:
              number: 80
```

It has to be noted that if any Host Rule specifies a AVI SSL Key Cert for the same host, then default Secret won't be used. Similarly if a Secret is specified in the TLS section of the Ingress Spec, then the default Secret won't be used.


### Passthrough Ingress:

In passthrough mode, an Ingress can be used to send secure traffic to the backend pods without TLS termination in AVI. To use this, the Ingress has to be annotated with the annotation `passthrough.ako.vmware.com/enabled: true`.

Like passthrough Routes in Openshift environment, a set of shared L4 Virtual Services are created by AKO to handle all tls passthrough hosts. These Virtual Services would listen on port 443 and have one L4 ssl datascript each. Name of the VS would be of the format clustername--'Shared-Passthrough'-shardnumner. Number of shards can be configured using the flag `passthroughShardSize` while installation using helm.


```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: ingress1
  annotations:
    passthrough.ako.vmware.com/enabled: "true"
spec:
  ingressClassName: avi-lb
  rules:
  - host: "pass.avi.internal"
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /foo
        backend:
          service:
            name: avisvc1
            port:
              number: 80
```

For each passthrough host, one unique Poolgroup is created and the Poolgroup is attached to the datascript of the VS derived by the sharding logic. One pool is also attached to the corresponding PoolGroup.

For passthrough hosts in Ingress, another Virtual Service is created for each shared L4 VS, to handle insecure traffic on port 80. HTTP Request polices would be added in this VS for each passthrough hosts to send a HTTP redirect response for insecure traffic. Both the Virtual Services listening on port 443 and 80 have a common VSVip. This allows DNS VS to resolve the hostname to one IP address consistently. The name of the insecure shared VS would be of the format clustername--'Shared-Passthrough'-shard-number-'insecure'.

#### AviInfrasetting Support in Passthrough Ingress

AviInfraSetting can be applied to the passthrough ingress through ingress class as shown [here](../crds/avinfrasetting.md#ingress). After applying AviInfrasetting to the ingress, a new set of L4 shared virtual services will be mapped to the host of the ingress.<br>
Name of the VS, that would listen on port 443, would be of the format `<cluster-name>--Shared-Passthrough-<aviinfrasetting-name>-<shardnumber>`. Name of the VS, that would listen for insecure traffic, would be of the format `<cluster-name>--Shared-Passthrough-<aviinfrasetting-name>-<shardnumber>-insecure`. For each Fqdn, a new unique poolgroup and pool will be created. Name of the poolgroup would be of the format `<cluster-name>--<aviinfrasetting-name>-<hostname>`. Name of the pool would be of the format `<cluster-name>--<aviinfrasetting-name>-<hostname>-<servicename>`.
