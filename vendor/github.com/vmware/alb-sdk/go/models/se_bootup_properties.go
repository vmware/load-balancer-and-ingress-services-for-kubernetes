	// Granularity or Resolution of co-ordinates used. When the value is 1 the co-ordinates provided in the geo-db are used as is (highest resolution.This value provides a 'zoom-out' value so that coarser co-ordinates are used. With higher resolution, logs can contain finer location information. But, lower resolution provides significant memory and cpu benefits on the service engine. Besides, given a smaller number of members that are separated geographically, a lower resolution is sufficient for correct load-balancing. Allowed values are 1-20. Field introduced in 17.1.1.
