	// Configure TCP health monitor to use half-open TCP connections to monitor the health of backend servers thereby avoiding consumption of a full fledged server side connection and the overhead and logs associated with it.  This method is light-weight as it makes use of listener in server's kernel layer to measure the health and a child socket or user thread is not created on the server side.
