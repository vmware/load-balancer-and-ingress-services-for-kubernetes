Allowed in Enterprise edition with any value, Essentials, Basic, Enterprise with Cloud Services edition.
	Edns *bool `json:"edns,omitempty"`

	// Specifies the IP address prefix length to use in the EDNS client subnet (ECS) option. When the incoming request does not have any ECS option and the prefix length is specified, an ECS option is inserted in the request passed to upstream server. If the incoming request already has an ECS option, the prefix length (and correspondingly the address) in the ECS option is updated, with the minimum of the prefix length present in the incoming and the configured prefix length, before passing the request to upstream server. Allowed values are 1-32. Field introduced in 17.1.3. Allowed in Enterprise edition with any value, Essentials, Basic, Enterprise with Cloud Services edition.
	EdnsClientSubnetPrefixLen *int32 `json:"edns_client_subnet_prefix_len,omitempty"`
