	AsyncInterval *int32 `json:"async_interval,omitempty"`

	// Max retries after which the remote site is treated as a fresh start. In fresh start all the configs are downloaded. Allowed values are 1-1024.
	ClearOnMaxRetries *int32 `json:"clear_on_max_retries,omitempty"`

	// Group to specify if the client ip addresses are public or private. Field introduced in 17.1.2.

	LeaderClusterUUID *string `json:"leader_cluster_uuid"`

	// This field disables the configuration operations on the leader for all federated objects.  CUD operations on Gslb, GslbService, GslbGeoDbProfile and other federated objects will be rejected. The rest-api disabling helps in upgrade scenarios where we don't want configuration sync operations to the Gslb member when the member is being upgraded.  This configuration programmatically blocks the leader from accepting new Gslb configuration when member sites are undergoing upgrade. . Field introduced in 17.2.1.

	// The user can specify a send-interval while entering maintenance mode. The validity of this 'maintenance send-interval' is only during maintenance mode. When the user leaves maintenance mode, the original send-interval is reinstated. This internal variable is used to store the original send-interval. . Field introduced in 18.2.3. Unit is SEC.
