# Load Balancer and Ingress Services for Kubernetes

## Architecture

The Avi Kubernetes Operator (AKO) is used to provide L4-L7 load balancing for applications deployed
in a kubernetes cluster for north-south traffic.

The AKO controller ingests the Kubernetes API server object updates
to construct corresponding objects in the Avi controller. The Avi controller then programs
the datapath using appropriate APIs to enable traffic routing for requested applications.
