 - Unblock AKO run if CRDs are not installed in cluster.
 - Fixed incorrect virtual service uuid annotation update for openshift secure routes with InsecureEdgeTermination set to Allow.

## AKO-1.5.1

### Added:
 - Add support for programming FQDN for L4 services via Gateway object when `servicesAPI` is set to `true`.
 - Multi-Protocol (TCP/UDP) support in gateway VS (shared VIP).
 - Make Service of type LoadBalancer work together with Gateways when using `serviceAPI` is set to `true`.
 - Public IP support for AKO on public clouds.
 - Support for passthrough hosts in Ingress.
 - Support for SAML based authentication for AKO using AuthToken as an alternative to usernme and password based authentication.
 - EVH support for Openshift.
 - NSX-T cloud support for VLAN and overlay based segments.
 - Support label based BGP peering for VSes.
 - Add markers to AVI objects.
 - Add length restriction on Avi object name upto 255 characters in SNI deployment.

### Changed:
 - Deprecate `subnetIP` and `subnetPrefix` in values.yaml, in favor of `cidr` field within `vipNetworkList`.
 - Update `spec.network` to include `networkName` and `cidr` information in AviInfraSetting CRD.
 - Encode Avi object names in EVH deployment.

### Known Issues
 - AKO update ingress status with VIP instead of public IP when public IP is enabled in public cloud deployments.

## AKO-1.5.2

### Added:
 - Bootup optimizations improves AKO’s boot time in scaled environments.
 - Support for HTTPRule CRD for Routes without paths.
 - Support for `Service` with multiple ports in EVH.

### Changed
 - In SNI deployment,  Host rule CRD with sslkeycertificate reference would get applied successfully to virtual service. However, upon deletion of this CRD, this virtual service would loose all cert configuration and get default cert. This issue is fixed.
 - In EVH deployment, existing certificate references on parent VS are overwritten if ingress (with host and secret) and Host rule CRD (with sslkeyandcertificate reference and different host) would get applied to same parent VS. Expected behaviour is to append all cert references belongs to different hosts that maps to same parent. This issue is fixed.

### Known Issues
 - Due to the use of Informers for Secrets, there is an adverse effect on bootup time in OpenShift based setups. AKO can further optimize bootup time on openshift setup by filtering out the Secrets on `avi-system` namespace. This feature will be added in 1.6.1
 - `ServiceType` of `NodePort` does not support multi-port `Services` with port number.


 ## AKO-1.6.1

 ### Added:
 - AKO now claims support for Kubernetes 1.22.
 - Support multi-port `Services` with port number for `ServiceType` of `NodePort` and `NodePortLocal`.

 - Support custom port numbers for dedicated and shared virtual services through HostRule CRD.
 - Support for enabling/disabling non-significant logs through HostRule CRD.
 - Add autoFQDN to shared virtual services.
 - Support for Analytics Profile for virtual service through HostRule CRD.
 - Support for Static IP for Shared and Dedicated virtual service through HostRule CRD.
 - Tenant context support for SE group.
 - Support for multiple alias FQDNs for a host through HostRule CRD.
 - Support to configure `Pool Placement Setting` for child ingresses/routes/svclb through AviInfraSetting CRD.
 - Allow programming static routes by adding custom Pod CIDR to Node mapping via annotation.

### Changed:
- Update `annotation` instead of `status` field of AKO statefulset after avi object deletion through `deleteConfig` flag.
- AKO will create single HTTP Policyset object at Avi Controller side for all paths of same host.

### Known Issues:
 - AviInfraSetting CR can not be applied to passthrough ingress/route.
 - AKO is not updating the ingress status when annotation `passthrough.ako.vmware.com/enabled: "true"` is added to the ingress.
 - There are issues when shardVS size changed through AviInfra CR or values.yaml. Recommended workflow is to first delete existing config using `deleteConfig` flag as described [here](docs/faq.md#how-do-i-clean-up-all-my-configs) and then change `shardVS` size through AviInfraSetting.

 - Fix: Every SEGroup used in the AviInfraSetting is getting configured with the labels even when `disableStaticRouteSync` is set to `true`.
 - Fix: AKO pod keeps getting error "panic: runtime error: slice bounds out of range" then goes into CrashLoopBackOff state.

 - Fixed: AKO is not cleaning up ISTIO resources even if istio is disabled or `deleteConfig` is set to `true`.
 - Fixed: Virtual service is not getting updated if alternate cert is updated or deleted in hostrule CRD.
 - Fixed: AVI controller requires SSL profile to be set to enable SSL on pool for controller versions lower than 22.x.

### Known Issues

 - `vipNetworks` and `nodeNetworks` in [aviinfrasetting crd](docs/crds/avinfrasetting.md) are updated with new field `networUUID` to specify network with uuid. User can specify either `networUUID` or `networkName` as part of these fields.

This SEG is defined either in AviInfrasetting CRD or in AKO configmap.

 ## AKO-1.11.1

 - Add Hostname from external-dns annotation only when AutoFQDN is flat or default for service type LB.
 - Reduce the length of the label created by the AKO when the AutoFQDN is set as flat for service of Type LB.
 - Do not add gslbFqdn, mentioned in Hostrule, to the vsvip fqdn when AKO is running in Dedicated mode.

### Fixed
 - Fix: AKO programs routes with secondary IPs in Openshift.
 - Fix: When HTTPRules are applied to the ingresses, with same FQDN and path but deployed in different namespaces, then httprule config is removed from one of the pool when another httprule is applied.
 - Fix: VS and Pools are not deleted when multiple ingress use same infrasetting for shard size.
 - Fix: DNS mentioned in `external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname` is not added as part `host-fqdn-vs-uuid-map` or vsvip dns info if `ako.vmware.com/enable-shared-vip` annotation is also applied to the LB service.
 - Fix: Dedicated insecure VS gets both port `80` and `443` by default when no listeners are defined via any CRD.
 - Fix: If only `loadBalancerIP` is given and no `listeners` are specified in the HostRule `tcpSettings` section, the VS creation fails with `error: Service mandatory for Virtual Service`.

 ### Known Issues
 - For Avi Controller version less than `30.1.1`, when using SSORule CRD, if `authnReqAcsType` is set to `SAML_AUTHN_REQ_ACS_TYPE_URL`, **Request Body Buffering** needs to be enabled for EVH parent virtual service for SAML traffic to work. This can be achieved by creating a custom application profile of type `HTTP` in the AVI controller with **Request Body Buffering** enabled and attaching that application profile to the EVH parent VS by using a HostRule CRD object. Avi Controller version `30.1.1` is supported starting with AKO version `1.11.1`.

## AKO-1.11.2

### Fixed

### Fixed
 - Fix: Certificate, from hostrule CRD, can not be assigned to L7 VirtualService when AKO is deployed in Dedicated mode.
 - Fix: Virtualservices are getting deleted when there is an issue with an access to the kube_api server which results in setting up `deleteConfig` flag to true.

## AKO-1.12.1

### Added

- AKO supports LoadBalancerClass for LoadBalancer type services.

- AKO shows all IPV4 and IPV6 addresses associated with VirtualService as part of Ingress, LoadBalancer status.
- AKO updates Route's `Status:Reason` field with vsuuid and controller uuid.

### Fixed
- AKO allows VIP to be IPV6 for LoadBalancer type services.
- Fix: Static routes are not added due to an error: `Field check for static_routes failed: Unique constraints route_id has duplicated value` when calico CNI allocates multiple block-affinities for a node and that may result in AKO crash.
- Fix: Failure in creating Virtual Service, PoolGroup and other Pools if name of one of the Pool, attached to PoolGroup, exceeds maximum Avi Controller name length limit.

### Known Issue
- L4 Rule CRD, with `enableSSL: true` in listener propterties, will not be applied to L4 Virtual Service if Avi Controller license is of type `Enterprise with Cloud Service`.
