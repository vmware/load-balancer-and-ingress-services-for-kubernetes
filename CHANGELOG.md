 - Unblock AKO run if CRDs are not installed in cluster.
 - Fixed incorrect virtual service uuid annotation update for openshift secure routes with InsecureEdgeTermination set to Allow.

## AKO-1.5.1

### Added:
 - Add support for programming FQDN for L4 services via Gateway object when `servicesAPI` is set to `true`.
 - Multi-Protocol (TCP/UDP) support in gateway VS (shared VIP).
 - Make Service of type LoadBalancer work together with Gateways when using `serviceAPI` is set to `true`.
 - Public IP support for AKO on public clouds.
 - Support for passthrough hosts in Ingress.
 - Support for SAML based authentication for AKO using AuthToken as an alternative to usernme and password based authentication.
 - EVH support for Openshift.
 - NSX-T cloud support for VLAN and overlay based segments.
 - Support label based BGP peering for VSes.
 - Add markers to AVI objects.
 - Add length restriction on Avi object name upto 255 characters in SNI deployment.

### Changed:
 - Deprecate `subnetIP` and `subnetPrefix` in values.yaml, in favor of `cidr` field within `vipNetworkList`.
 - Update `spec.network` to include `networkName` and `cidr` information in AviInfraSetting CRD.
 - Encode Avi object names in EVH deployment.

### Known Issues
 - AKO update ingress status with VIP instead of public IP when public IP is enabled in public cloud deployments.

## AKO-1.5.2

### Added:
 - Bootup optimizations improves AKO’s boot time in scaled environments.
 - Support for HTTPRule CRD for Routes without paths.
 - Support for `Service` with multiple ports in EVH.

### Changed
 - In SNI deployment,  Host rule CRD with sslkeycertificate reference would get applied successfully to virtual service. However, upon deletion of this CRD, this virtual service would loose all cert configuration and get default cert. This issue is fixed.
 - In EVH deployment, existing certificate references on parent VS are overwritten if ingress (with host and secret) and Host rule CRD (with sslkeyandcertificate reference and different host) would get applied to same parent VS. Expected behaviour is to append all cert references belongs to different hosts that maps to same parent. This issue is fixed.

### Known Issues
 - Due to the use of Informers for Secrets, there is an adverse effect on bootup time in OpenShift based setups. AKO can further optimize bootup time on openshift setup by filtering out the Secrets on `avi-system` namespace. This feature will be added in 1.6.1
 - `ServiceType` of `NodePort` does not support multi-port `Services` with port number.


 ## AKO-1.6.1

 ### Added:
 - AKO now claims support for Kubernetes 1.22.
 - Support multi-port `Services` with port number for `ServiceType` of `NodePort` and `NodePortLocal`.
 - AKO introduces support for broadcasting kubernetes `Events` in order to enhance the observability and monitoring aspects.
 - Support custom port numbers for dedicated and shared virtual services through HostRule CRD.
 - Support for enabling/disabling non-significant logs through HostRule CRD.
 - Add autoFQDN to shared virtual services.
 - Support for Analytics Profile for virtual service through HostRule CRD.
 - Support for Static IP for Shared and Dedicated virtual service through HostRule CRD.
 - Tenant context support for SE group.
 - Support for multiple alias FQDNs for a host through HostRule CRD.
 - Support to configure `Pool Placement Setting` for child ingresses/routes/svclb through AviInfraSetting CRD.
 - Allow programming static routes by adding custom Pod CIDR to Node mapping via annotation.

### Changed:
- Update `annotation` instead of `status` field of AKO statefulset after avi object deletion through `deleteConfig` flag.
- AKO will create single HTTP Policyset object at Avi Controller side for all paths of same host.

### Known Issues:
 - AviInfraSetting CR can not be applied to passthrough ingress/route.
 - AKO is not updating the ingress status when annotation `passthrough.ako.vmware.com/enabled: "true"` is added to the ingress.
 - There are issues when shardVS size changed through AviInfra CR or values.yaml. Recommended workflow is to first delete existing config using `deleteConfig` flag as described [here](docs/faq.md#how-do-i-clean-up-all-my-configs) and then change `shardVS` size through AviInfraSetting.

 - Issue: FQDN aliases not getting added to all the HTTP policies.
 - Fixes improper dedicated VS creation of Service of type LB when Gateways and ServiceLB used at the same time.
 - Fixes an issue of an empty string fqdn programming in L4 VSVIP when autoFqdn is disabled and no subDomains are configured in the dnsProfile.
 - Fixes an issue of SEG label configuration during AviInfraSetting validation if static route sync is disabled.

### Changed

 - Allow AKO to continue clean up of avi objects when AKO boots up with `deleteConfig` flag set to true.
 - In EVH deployment, if AKO is processing two hosts, that belongs to same parent virtual service, AKO continues to process the next host even if the current host has errors except if the error code is:
    1. Between 500 to 509

 - Fixes LoadBalancer service creation with named ports in NodePortLocal deployment.
 - Fix: Every SEGroup used in the AviInfraSetting is getting configured with the labels even when `disableStaticRouteSync` is set to `true`.
 - Fix: AKO pod keeps getting error "panic: runtime error: slice bounds out of range" then goes into CrashLoopBackOff state.


## AKO-1.7.2

### Added
 - Support for AviInfraSetting CRD for Shared Virtual Service of type LoadBalancer

### Fixed
 - Fix: HTTP Rule will be rejected if `pkiProfile` or `destinationCA` is not defined while defining `tls` section of rule.
