### This section outlines the generic AKO settings
AKOSettings:
  logLevel: "WARN" # enum: INFO|DEBUG|WARN|ERROR
  fullSyncFrequency: "1800" # This frequency controls how often AKO polls the Avi controller to update itself with cloud configurations.
  apiServerPort: 8080 # Internal port for AKO's API server for the liveness probe of the AKO pod default=8080
  deleteConfig: "false" # Has to be set to true in configmap if user wants to delete AKO created objects from AVI 
  disableStaticRouteSync: "false" # If the POD networks are reachable from the Avi SE, set this knob to true.
  clusterName: "my-cluster" # A unique identifier for the kubernetes cluster, that helps distinguish the objects for this cluster in the avi controller. // MUST-EDIT
  cniPlugin: "" # Set the string if your CNI is calico or openshift. enum: calico|canal|flannel|openshift|antrea
  enableEVH: false # This enables the Enhanced Virtual Hosting Model in Avi Controller for the Virtual Services
  GRBAC: false # Granular RBAC support, switched off by default
  layer7Only: false # If this flag is switched on, then AKO will only do layer 7 loadbalancing.
  # NamespaceSelector contains label key and value used for namespacemigration
  # Same label has to be present on namespace/s which needs migration/sync to AKO
  namespaceSelector:
    labelKey: ""
    labelValue: ""
  servicesAPI: false # Flag that enables AKO in services API mode: https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/service-apis/. Currently implemented only for L4. This flag uses the upstream GA APIs which are not backward compatible 
                     # with the advancedL4 APIs which uses a fork and a version of v1alpha1pre1 

### This section outlines the network settings for virtualservices. 
NetworkSettings:
  ## This list of network and cidrs are used in pool placement network for vcenter cloud.
  ## Node Network details are not needed when in nodeport mode / static routes are disabled / non vcenter clouds.
  nodeNetworkList: []
  # nodeNetworkList:
  #   - networkName: "network-name"
  #     cidrs:
  #       - 10.0.0.1/24
  #       - 11.0.0.1/24
  subnetIP: "" # Subnet IP of the vip network
  subnetPrefix: "" # Subnet Prefix of the vip network
  networkName: "" # Network Name of the vip network
  enableRHI: false # This is a cluster wide setting for BGP peering.
  vipNetworkList: []
  # vipNetworkList: []
  #  - networkName: subnet-xxxxxxx

### This section outlines all the knobs  used to control Layer 7 loadbalancing settings in AKO.
L7Settings:
  defaultIngController: "true"
  noPGForSNI: false # Switching this knob to true, will get rid of poolgroups from SNI VSes. Do not use this flag, if you don't want http caching. This will be deprecated once the controller support caching on PGs.
  serviceType: ClusterIP # enum NodePort|ClusterIP|NodePortLocal
  shardVSSize: "LARGE" # Use this to control the layer 7 VS numbers. This applies to both secure/insecure VSes but does not apply for passthrough. ENUMs: LARGE, MEDIUM, SMALL, DEDICATED
  passthroughShardSize: "SMALL" # Control the passthrough virtualservice numbers using this ENUM. ENUMs: LARGE, MEDIUM, SMALL

### This section outlines all the knobs  used to control Layer 4 loadbalancing settings in AKO.
L4Settings:
  advancedL4: "false" # Use this knob to control the settings for the services API usage. Default to not using services APIs: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/service-apis
  defaultDomain: "" # If multiple sub-domains are configured in the cloud, use this knob to set the default sub-domain to use for L4 VSes.
  autoFQDN: "default" # ENUM: default(<svc>.<ns>.<subdomain>), flat (<svc>-<ns>.<subdomain>), "disabled" If the value is disabled then the FQDN generation is disabled.

### This section outlines settings on the Avi controller that affects AKO's functionality.
ControllerSettings:
  serviceEngineGroupName: "Default-Group" # Name of the ServiceEngine Group.
  controllerVersion: "18.2.10" # The controller API version
  cloudName: "Default-Cloud" # The configured cloud name on the Avi controller.
  controllerHost: "" # IP address or Hostname of Avi Controller
  tenantsPerCluster: "false" # If set to true, AKO will map each kubernetes cluster uniquely to a tenant in Avi
  tenantName: "admin" # Name of the tenant where all the AKO objects will be created in AVI. // Required only if tenantsPerCluster is set to True

nodePortSelector: # Only applicable if serviceType is NodePort
